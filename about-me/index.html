    <h3>About Me:</h3> 
    <p>I enjoy hanging out with my friends whenever it is decently warm outside, 
        as well as play games with them. My friend group and I usually hang out every week or so 
        doing whatever. One time we were bored so we hiked through a forest following a river.  I am a very 
        outgoing person and enjoy computer science.  I will probably be attending BlackHawk Technical College 
        and transferring to WhiteWater to get a degree in Computer Science.
