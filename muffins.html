    <h1>Muffins, the early years</h1> <hr>
    <p>Hi. My name is Muffins. I am a mighty
    cat. I was adopted by my family when I was 
    only three weeks old.</p>
    <p>My new mommy is a human. They are 
    funny creatures.</p>
    <p>I left the pound with my new mommy and 
    new sister, Maria.  They took me straight 
    to the pet store to buy: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>A kitty baby bottle and formula</li>
        <li>A small cloth toy</li>
        <li>Litter box with litter</li>
        <li>Food (for later)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Mom and sis had to feed me 
    by bottle because I was so young.</p>
